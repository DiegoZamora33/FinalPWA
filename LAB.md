# LABORATORY

## General description.

My project uses the *theme of a clinical analysis laboratory.*

It consists of a *main web page visible to all public users*, in this main page you can see laboratory publications, image gallery, leave comments, see news that the laboratory staff wishes to publish and if you are a client of the laboratory you can see and download your clinical analysis results with a unique code per client.

For the administrators of the site and the laboratory, they have an *authentication login to access the administrative functions of the site*, in my project I decided to establish 3 types of user that have access to the administration functions of the web system.

**Administrator User:** This user can create and delete users, manage customer files, manage the publications and images that are displayed on the main page of the site and manage the comments that customers write on the site.

**Chemical User:** This user can only manage customer files.

**Publisher User:** This user will only manage the publications of the main page of the website and the images that are displayed on the main page.
